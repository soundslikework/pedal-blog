  title: Guitar effects reviews, vintage and weird
  description: >
    We've been playing guitar for decades, and in that amount of time,
    we've owned a bunch of stuff. Also, most guitar effects blogs are terrible.
    The next logical step after realizing both of these things was to simply start
    our own blog. Here you'll find some rambling thoughts about weird old effects pedals,
    learn what happens when you push an Ibanez flanger past its limits, and there'll probably
    be a bunch of long digressions about sci-fi novels too. So... Enjoy?
